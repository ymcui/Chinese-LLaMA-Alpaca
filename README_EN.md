Large Language Models (LLM), represented by ChatGPT and GPT-4, have sparked a new wave of research in the field of natural language processing, demonstrating capabilities of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and attracting widespread attention from the industry. However, the expensive training and deployment of large language models have posed certain obstacles to building transparent and open academic research.

To promote open research of large models in the Chinese NLP community, this project has open-sourced the **Chinese LLaMA model and the Alpaca large model with instruction fine-tuning**. These models expand the Chinese vocabulary based on the original LLaMA and use Chinese data for secondary pre-training, further enhancing Chinese basic semantic understanding. Additionally, the project uses Chinese instruction data for fine-tuning on the basis of the Chinese LLaMA, significantly improving the model's understanding and execution of instructions.

***Disclaimer: Resources related to this project are for academic research purposes only.***

**Main contents of this project:**

- 🚀 Extended Chinese vocabulary on top of original LLaMA with significant encode/decode efficiency
- 🚀 Open-sourced the Chinese LLaMA large model pre-trained on Chinese text data  (7B, 13B)
- 🚀 Open-sourced the Chinese Alpaca large model with further instruction fine-tuning (7B, 13B)
- 🚀 Quickly deploy and experience the quantized version of the large model on CPU of your laptop (personal PC) 

💡 The following image shows the actual experience effect of the 7B version model after local deployment (animation unaccelerated, tested on Apple M1 Max).

## Model Download

### ⚠️ User Notice (Must Read)

The official [LLaMA models released by Facebook prohibits commercial use](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), and the official model weights have not been open-sourced (although there are many third-party download links available online). In order to comply with the relevant licenses, it is currently not possible to release the complete model weights. We appreciate your understanding. After Facebook fully opens up the model weights, this project will update its policies accordingly. **What is released here are the LoRA weights**, which can be seen as a "patch" for the original LLaMA model, and the complete weights can be obtained by merging the two.


### Chinese LLaMA

The Chinese LLaMA model has expanded the Chinese vocabulary on the basis of the original version, and used Chinese plain text data for secondary pre-training. For details, see the [Training Details](#Training-Details) section.

### Footnote and Others

**[1]** The original LLaMA model needs to be applied for use in [Facebook-LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) or refer to this [PR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/pull/73/files). Due to copyright issues, this project cannot provide downloads, and we ask for your understanding.

**[2]** The reconstructed model is slightly larger than the original LLaMA (due to the expanded vocabulary); the 7B model is about 13G+.

**[3]** After downloading, be sure to check whether the SHA256 of the ZIP file is consistent; for the full value, please see [SHA256.md](./SHA256.md).

The file directory inside the ZIP file is as follows (using Chinese-LLaMA as an example):

```
chinese_llama_lora_7b/
  - adapter_config.json       # LoRA weight configuration file
  - adapter_model.bin         # LoRA weight file
  - special_tokens_map.json   # special_tokens_map file
  - tokenizer_config.json     # tokenizer configuration file
  - tokenizer.model           # tokenizer file
```

The following is the size of each original model and 4-bit quantization. When converting the corresponding model, make sure that the machine has enough memory and disk space (minimum requirements):

|                    |   7B   |  13B   |   33B   |   65B   |
| :----------------- | :----: | :----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Original（FP16）   | 13 GB  | 24 GB  |  60 GB  | 120 GB  |
| Quantized（4-bit） | 3.9 GB | 7.8 GB | 19.5 GB | 38.5 GB |

## Model Reconstruction

### Online Conversion

**[New] After memory optimization, Colab free users can now convert 7B and 13B models online!**

If you are familiar with Google Colab (if you have Pro and higher subscriptions), you can use our written Notebook to combine and quantify models online.

- Support online conversion of LLaMA/Alpaca model 7B and 13B versions
- After the run is over, you can download the combined full volume and quantized weights on demand (you can also transfer to your own Google Drive)
- For specific steps, please move to the Google Colab notebook to view and run it (also available in the `notebooks` directory, for reference): <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Eak6azD3MLeb-YsfbP8UZC8wrL1ddIMI?usp=sharing" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

### Preparation

1. Make sure the machine has enough memory to load the complete model (e.g., 13-15G for the 7B model) for the model merging operation.

2. Before merging, make sure that the SHA256 of the base model and the LoRA model patch files are consistent with those in [SHA256.md](./SHA256.md), otherwise, the merge operation cannot be performed.

   - The original LLaMA contains the following files: `tokenizer.model`, `tokenizer_checklist.chk`, `consolidated.00.pth`, `params.json`

   - The SHA256 of the weight file `consolidated.00.pth`: `700df0d3013b703a806d2ae7f1bfb8e59814e3d06ae78be0c66368a50059f33d`

3. Dependencies:
   - ⚠️ **You MUST use the [latest 🤗Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#install-from-source)**. The current release v4.27 does not support LLaMA. 
   - install `sentencepiece` and `peft` using `pip` command


 ```bash
 pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
 pip install sentencepiece
 pip install peft
 ```

### Step 1: Convert the original LLaMA model to HF format

Use the script [convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py) provided by the [latest 🤗transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#install-from-source) to convert the original LLaMA model to HuggingFace format. *This project is not responsible for the compliance and correctness of using third-party (non-Facebook official) weights, such as the `decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf` in the HuggingFace model library (use at your own risk).*

⚠️ Please put the original LLaMA's `tokenizer.model` file in`--input_dir`, and the other files in `${input_dir}/${model_size}`.

```bash
python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir path_to_original_llama_root_dir \
    --model_size 7B \
    --output_dir path_to_original_llama_hf_dir
```

### Step 2: Merge LoRA weights to generate full model weights

This step will expand the Chinese vocabulary of the original LLaMA model (HF format), merge LoRA weights, and generate full model weights. There are two options available here:

- ✅ If you need quantize and deploy our model: output the weight of PyTorch version (`. pth` file) using `scripts/merge_llama_with_chinese_lora.py` script
- ❎ If you DO NOT need quantize and deploy our model: output the weight of the HuggingFace version (such as for further fine-tuning), using `scripts/merge_llama_with_chinese_lora_to_hf.py` script (thanks @sgsdxzy)

The parameters that need to be set for the above two scripts are consistent, but the output file format is different. The followings are command lines for generating `.pth` file (need further quantize and deploy our model). 

```bash
python scripts/merge_llama_with_chinese_lora.py \
    --base_model path_to_original_llama_hf_dir \
    --lora_model path_to_chinese_llama_or_alpaca_lora \
    --output_dir path_to_output_dir
```

where:

- `--base_model`: directory where the HF format LLaMA model weights and configuration files are saved (generated in Step 1)
- `--lora_model`: directory where the Chinese LLaMA/Alpaca LoRA model compressed file downloaded in the previous section is located, or the model name on Hugging Face Model Hub: `ziqingyang/chinese-alpaca-lora-7b` or `ziqingyang/chinese-llama-lora-7b`
- `--output_model`: directory to save the consolidated model weights (default: `./`)
- (optional) `--offload_dir`: for low-RAM users, please specify a offload directory

*(Optional) If necessary, you can convert the `.pth` files generated in this step to HuggingFace format using the script in Step 1.*

## Quick Deployment

The research community has developed many excellent model quantization and deployment tools to help users **easily deploy large models locally on their own computers (CPU!)**. In the following, we'll take the [llama.cpp tool](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) as an example and introduce the detailed steps to quantize and deploy the model on MacOS and Linux systems. For Windows, you may need to install build tools like cmake. **For a local quick deployment experience, it is recommended to use the instruction-finetuned Alpaca model.**

Before running, please ensure:

1. The model quantization process requires loading the entire unquantized model into memory, so make sure there is enough available memory (7B version requires more than 13G).
2. When loading the quantized model (e.g., the 7B version), ensure that the available memory on the machine is greater than 4-6G (affected by context length).
3. The system should have `make` (built-in for MacOS/Linux) or `cmake` (need to be installed separately for Windows) build tools.
4. It is recommended to use Python 3.9 or 3.10 to build and run the [llama.cpp tool](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) (since `sentencepiece` does not yet support 3.11).

### Step 1: Clone and build llama.cpp

Run the following commands to build the llama.cpp project, generating `./main` and `./quantize` binary files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make
```

### Step 2: Generate a quantized model

Depending on the type of model you want to convert (LLaMA or Alpaca), place the `tokenizer.*` files from the downloaded LoRA model package into the `zh-models` directory, and place the `params.json`  and the `consolidate.*.pth` model file obtained in the last step of [Model Reconstruction](#Model-Reconstruction) into the `zh-models/7B` directory. Note that the `.pth` model file and `tokenizer.model` are corresponding, and the `tokenizer.model` for LLaMA and Alpaca should not be mixed. The directory structure should be similar to:

```
llama.cpp/zh-models/
   - 7B/
     - consolidated.00.pth
     - params.json
   - tokenizer.model
```

Convert the above `.pth` model weights to ggml's FP16 format, and generate a file with the path `zh-models/7B/ggml-model-f16.bin`.

```bash
python convert-pth-to-ggml.py zh-models/7B/ 1
```

Further quantize the FP16 model to 4-bit, and generate a quantized model file with the path `zh-models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin`.

```bash
./quantize ./zh-models/7B/ggml-model-f16.bin ./zh-models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin 2
```

### Step 3: Load and start the model

Run the `./main` binary file, with the `-m` command specifying the 4-bit quantized model (or loading the ggml-FP16 model). Below is an example of decoding parameters:

```bash
./main -m zh-models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin --color -f ./prompts/alpaca.txt -ins -c 2048 --temp 0.2 -n 256 --repeat_penalty 1.3
```

Please enter your prompt after the `>`, use `\` as the end of the line for multi-line inputs. To view help and parameter instructions, please execute the `./main -h` command. Here's a brief introduction to several important parameters:

```
-c controls the length of context, larger values allow for longer dialogue history to be referenced
-ins activates the conversation mode for the ChatGPT class
-n controls the maximum length of generated responses
--repeat_penalty controls the penalty for repeated text in the generated response
--temp is the temperature coefficient, lower values result in less randomness in the response, and vice versa
--top_p, top_k control the sampling parameters
```

## System Performance

In order to quickly evaluate the actual performance of related models, this project compared the effects of Chinese Alpaca-7B and Chinese Alpaca-13B on some common tasks given the same prompt. The test models are all **4-bit quantized models**, and the theoretical effect is worse than the non-quantized version. Reply generation is random and is affected by factors such as decoding hyperparameters and random seeds. The following related evaluations are not absolutely rigorous, and the test results are for reference only. Welcome to experience it yourself. For detailed evaluation results, please see [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md)

| 详细分析加班为什么在中国公司非常普遍                     | 在中国，加班通常是由于企业追求高效和生产力的驱动力所导致。由于中国的劳动力市场相对紧张且工资水平较低，许多企业的目标是提高生产率并降低成本来保持竞争力。因此，为了达到这些目的，很多企业会要求员工工作超过法定的工作时间限制或者额外支付加班费以鼓励他们更加努力地完成任务。此外，一些行业中（如制造业）也经常需要工人长时间连续工作的，这使得加班成为常态的一部分。 | 中国公司的员工经常需要加班的原因包括：工作量大、任务紧急性高、缺乏足够的人力资源等。此外，中国的文化中也强调了“奉献精神”和“努力奋斗的精神”。因此，在许多情况下，加班是被认为是一种积极的表现方式的必要条件之一。 |
| 列举几位你认为在人类历史上最伟大的科学家和他们的主要贡献 | 1. 爱因斯坦 - 他的相对论革命性地改变了我们对时间、空间和物质的理解，并为现代物理学奠定了基础。<br/>2. 阿尔伯特·图灵 - 他是量子力学理论的创始人之一，他的方程式描述了原子粒子的行为模式，以及电子与光子等基本物理现象。<br/>3. 玛丽亚娜·居里娅- 她发明了一种能够检测放射性元素的新方法，这使得她被誉为人类历史上第一位女化学家。她的发现也促进了医学的发展。 | 牛顿（Isaac Newton）：物理学、数学和天文学的开创者，提出了万有引力定律。<br/><br/>达尔文 (Charles Darwin)：进化论的提出人之一，阐述了物种演化的过程以及适应性生存机制的重要性。<br/><br/>爱因斯坦(Albert Einstein):相对论理论的创始人，揭示了我们对时间与空间的理解；他还发现了光子的存在并解释了电磁现象的本质。 |
| 请你详细分析是先有鸡还是鸡蛋？                           | 这是一个哲学上的问题，因为在科学上说前的和后的都无法被确定。因此，这个问题的答案取决于个人的观点或信仰。 | 这个问题涉及到哲学上的“本体论”问题，即关于事物的本质和起源的问题。从科学的角度来看，蛋壳中的卵子才是原始的生物物质，而孵化出来的雏鸟则是由母鸡所产的结果。因此可以说，先有的是蛋或卵子，而不是鸡或者母鸡本身。 |

| 你是一个作文生成器，请以《绿水青山就是金山银山》为题写一篇议论文。 | 《绿水青山就是金山银山》是一句古成语，意思是“自然风光和财富一样珍贵。”这句话的寓意是，自然资源和环境的重要性，它们不仅可以给人们带来快乐和幸福，而且也对社会经济的发展具有重要意义。在当今世界中，我们经常看到一些人为了追求金钱而忽视了环境保护问题。然而，环境问题已经成为了一个全球性的话题，越来越多的人开始关注环保问题，并采取行动来保护自然资源。在我看到的，一个重要的原因是，人们已经认识到了自然资源和环境的重要性。例如，许多人现在更加注重节约能源、减少污染等环保措施。这表明，人们对于环境保护问题的认识正在不断提高。因此，我认为，我们应该珍惜自然资源和环境，以保护它们为我们所处的美丽世界。只有这样，我们才能够享受到绿水青山就是金山银山的价值，并让它成为我们的财富。 | 随着城市化的不断推进和工业化进程的加速，越来越多的人开始意识到环境保护的重要性。“绿色”、“环保”等概念逐渐成为人们关注的话题之一。而这句话——“绿水青山就是金山银山”——则成为了人们对于保护环境的一种形象生动的说法。它强调了自然资源的价值与重要性，也提醒我们必须珍惜我们的地球家园并采取积极有效的措施去维护其生态平衡。<br/><br/>在当今社会中，许多人都认为金钱是一切，但实际上财富只是物质上的一种表现形式而已。然而，如果地球上的所有生物都不能生存或繁殖的话，那么钱再多也没用了。因此，我们要认识到的是：只有通过对生态环境的有效管理才能让我们拥有更多的时间和机会去做有意义的事情，从而实现真正的幸福感。<br/><br/>当然，要真正做到这一点并不容易。首先需要政府和社会各界共同努力，制定出更加严格的法律法规以及实施更完善的监管机制；其次，每个人都应该从自身做起，例如节约能源、减少污染排放等等。这些看似微不足道的小事却可以积少成多地推动整个社会的可持续发展方向。<br/><br/>总之，保护环境不仅是人类的责任，也是每个人应尽自己的义务的事业。只要大家都能像一句口号一样牢记住这一理念，我们就一定能够创造一个更为美好的未来！ |

## Training Details

The entire training process includes three parts: vocabulary expansion, pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning. The training code refers to the [run_clm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py) in 🤗transformers and the relevant parts of dataset processing in the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) project.

### Preparation: Vocabulary Expansion

Due to the limited support for Chinese (and other non-English languages) in the original LLaMA,

- We further expanded the Chinese vocabulary based on training with the general Chinese corpus using [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) to create a 20K Chinese vocabulary, which was then merged with the original LLaMA model's 32K vocabulary. 
- After removing duplicate tokens, the final Chinese LLaMA vocabulary size is 49,953.
- It should be noted that during the fine-tuning stage, Alpaca has one more pad token than LLaMA, so the Chinese Alpaca vocabulary size is 49,954.

For more information on the motivation behind expanding the Chinese vocabulary, please refer to the [FAQ](#FAQ).

### Pre-training

In the pre-training phase, the general Chinese corpora (consistent with the corpora used in [Chinese BERT-wwm](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm), [MacBERT](https://github.com/ymcui/MacBERT), [LERT](https://github.com/ymcui/LERT), [PERT](https://github.com/ymcui/PERT)) were used for further pre-training based on the original LLaMA weights. This process is divided into two stages:

1. Stage One: Fix the parameters of the transformer part of the model and only train the embedding, adapting the newly added Chinese word vectors without disturbing the original model as much as possible.
2. Stage Two: Use LoRA technology to add LoRA weights (adapter) to the model, and train the embedding while updating LoRA parameters.

### Instruction Fine-tuning

1. The task format of the instruction fine-tuning phase is basically the same as that of [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca). The training scheme also used LoRA for efficient fine-tuning and further increased the number of trainable parameters.
2. We follow the original prompt by [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) that without "input". For the data that contains "input" values, we simply concatenate them in the form of`f"{instruction}+\n+{input}"`.

### Training Data

During the instruction fine-tuning phase, about 2M data were used for 7B model, and 3M data for 13B model. Details:

This project provides a script `script/crawl_prompt.py` for dynamically generating prompts of different domains and instruction types.

```bash
python script/crawl_prompt.py output-file
```

- The idea is similar to the approach used in [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-generation-process). It generates 20 sets of data at a time (you can modify the templates), reducing the cost of crawling.
- The generated file contains data crawled through `gpt-3.5-turbo` (you must have an OpenAI API key to use it).
- Although the instruction template requires the output to be in JSON format, the system does not always return valid JSON, so you need to clean it up according to the returned data.
- Since crawling takes a long time, it is recommended to run this script in the background. When running multiple threads, pay attention to the [call limit of the OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/overview).

## Limitations

Although the models in this project have significantly improved Chinese understanding and generation capabilities compared to the original LLaMA and Alpaca, there are also the following limitations:

- It may produce unpredictable harmful content and content that does not conform to human preferences and values.
- Due to computing power and data issues, the training of the related models is not sufficient, and the Chinese understanding ability needs to be further improved.
- There is no online interactive demo available for now (Note: users can still deploy it locally themselves).

## FAQ

##### Q1: Why can't you release the complete model weights?

A: This question has been emphasized repeatedly before. The open source license for the LLaMA model does not allow us to do so, so related derivative work is seeking ways to bypass the restrictions. Please believe that we set up so many steps not to increase everyone's workload, but because of objective circumstances. After Facebook fully opens up the weights, we will release the complete model and directly loadable quantized models as soon as possible. During this period, we will also closely monitor other LLaMA-related repositories to see if there are better methods.

##### Q2: Will there be versions of 13B, 33B, and 65B in the future?

A: We cannot guarantee this at this time.

##### Q3: The model doesn't perform well on some tasks!

A: There are several possible reasons: 1) LLaMA itself has limited support for Chinese, and most related derivative work is pre-trained/finetuned directly on the original version, while we have taken a more bold strategy - expanding the Chinese vocabulary, which may further exacerbate the problem of insufficient Chinese training, but whether it is beneficial for subsequent pre-training in the long run remains to be seen over time; 2) the quality of instruction data needs to be further improved; 3) there is still a lot of room for adjustment in training time, hyperparameters, etc.; 4) there is no RLHF; 5) the Q4 quantization may cause a decrease in performance, so you can try loading the FP16 model, which is relatively better (but slower).

##### Q4: Why expand the vocabulary? Can't you just pre-train the original LLaMA with Chinese data?

A: The original LLaMA model's vocabulary size is 32K, mainly trained on English (see the [LLaMA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1) for more details), and support for multiple languages is not particularly ideal (you can compare the vocabulary size of the multilingual classic model XLM-R, which is 250K). Preliminary statistics show that the LLaMA vocabulary contains very few Chinese characters, so when cutting the words, the Chinese words are cut into smaller pieces, requiring multiple byte tokens to form a complete Chinese character, which leads to a decrease in information density. For example, in the model with the expanded vocabulary, a single Chinese character tends to be cut into one token, while in the original LLaMA, it may require 2-3 tokens to combine into one Chinese character, significantly reducing the efficiency of encoding and decoding.

##### Question 5: The reply is very short

Answer: It has been found that the Q4 quantitative model is more inclined to give short answers than the FP16 model. You can command to output a long reply in the prompt, such as "Please elaborate..." and so on. The remaining possible reasons include training data distribution, training parameters, decoding parameters, etc.

##### Question 6: Under Windows, the model cannot understand Chinese, the generation speed is very slow, etc.

Answer: If the model cannot understand Chinese and the generation speed is slow for Windows users, please refer to the solution in the following issue.
